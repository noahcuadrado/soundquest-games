# SoundQuest Brand Guidelines

## TL;DR

- SoundQuest helps learners tune their brain to the finite set of sounds in a language before forcing words and phrases
- We map what the learner already knows, spotlight 10–20 new phonemes, and guide them through a finite, game-like journey
- We start with vowels for comprehension, then target high-impact consonant contrasts
- Core feeling: clarity, control, and calm momentum; no overwhelm, no lore—just crisp signal

## Brand Essence

### Brand Promise
**Tune in before you speak.**

### Purpose
Replace vague repetition with a finite, learnable sound system.

### Differentiator
A phoneme-first map and live biofeedback to make invisible articulators visible.

### Narrative
From static and blur to signal lock. From guessing to recipe-driven mastery.

## Company Mission

- Make pronunciation and listening a finite, achievable path for every learner
- Teach the mental model of sound systems, not just mimicry
- Deliver fast wins that build confidence and momentum within minutes
- Lower the cost and friction of accent clarity via software-first feedback

## Product Pillars

### Starting Point Evaluation
- Identify L1, choose L2; generate a phoneme map: same/similar, small tweaks, and new/different
- Show the end state clearly and reduce overwhelm

### Recognition First
- Train the ear on L2 vs. L2 minimal pairs and L1 vs. L2 contrasts
- Use controlled recordings and nonsense syllables to eliminate confounds

### Vowel Visualizer
- Immediate, live feedback on tongue-body position to move from blind darts to eyes-open adjustment

### Finite Quest
- A map of discrete phoneme "levels." Progress is visible and finite; completion is possible

### Confidence Loops
- Rapid reps, streaks, small wins; learners feel "I can do this"

## Target Audience

- Learners who love discrete, finite tasks and visual progress
- Casual learners skeptical that accent can improve
- Advanced learners who want to close L1→L2 gaps efficiently

## Voice and Tone

### Guidelines
- Calm, precise, and encouraging
- Minimal jargon, concrete metaphors
- Avoid hype, lore, or punitive copy
- Emphasize clarity and agency

### Microcopy Patterns

**Correct:**
- "Locked on."

**Incorrect:**
- "A bit of static — try again."

**Tips:**
- "Switch to 'Nonsense' to isolate the sound."

### Response Style
- Headlines ≤ 7 words
- Subheads ≤ 14 words
- Bullets over paragraphs
- Concrete actions over abstractions
- When uncertain, ask for L1 and L2 first

## Imagery and Illustration

### Style Guidelines
- Use abstract sound waves
- Subdued glows
- IPA symbol constellations
- Prefer calm backgrounds with subtle motion over character-heavy scenes

### Conceptual Scenes (for onboarding)
- Confused learner with floating IPA symbols
- Out-of-sync → in-sync sound waves
- Overlapping native/target sound sets
- Quest path with glowing "stones"

### Moodboard Prompts
- "Minimal UI, soft teal glow (#1A535C), ivory surface (#FFF1E3), subtle scanline texture, abstract sound waves, IPA symbols, high legibility, calm"
- "Quest path of glowing stepping stones, thin line path, soft sparkles (#F9DBBD), no characters, focus on signal"
- "Two overlapping circles labeled L1/L2 with highlighted shared symbols, gentle energy beam connection"
- "Radio dial metaphor: from fuzzy static to crisp tuned waves, no skeuomorphism"

## Product Surfaces and Content

### Onboarding (7-scene deck)
1. Problem/blur
2. Why
3. Languages aren't random
4. What you already know
5. Quest
6. You already know X%
7. Guide ready

### Evaluation
**Input:** Native language(s) and target language

**Output:** Phoneme map with legend (green/amber/red) and suggested starting nodes

### Lessons
**Hear it:** Fast reps to ≥80% accuracy; contexts: nonsense, minimal pairs, words

**Say it:** Visualizer targets, hold stability for reps; mic check and feedback

### Review Game
- Light-tension timed activity
- Wrong picks add subtle "static"
- Correct picks lift the signal

## Learning Method Foundation

### Core Principles
- Distinguish within L2 (minimal pairs) and between L1 vs. L2
- Represent with IPA; make IPA approachable via gamified spaced repetition
- Make the sounds:
  - **Vowels:** prioritize; use live articulatory feedback to build a mental model
  - **Consonants:** teach targeted "special cases" that impact meaning or fluency

### Why Vowels First
- Vowels shape rhythm and meaning; mispronunciation confuses listeners
- Consonant deviations often signal accent more than they block comprehension
- Prioritize high-yield vowel contrasts (e.g., /i/ vs /ɪ/)

### Map → Journey → Win State
- Visualize the end state (dial locked to frequency; crisp signal)
- Show the exact steps; finite, discrete path with visible progress
- Teach one thing immediately to create momentum and trust

## Onboarding Copy Examples

**Welcome:**
- "Tune in before you speak."
- Subhead: "Languages run on small sets of sounds. Master a few; the rest aligns."

**L1:** "Which language shaped your voice early on?"

**L2:** "What language are you tuning to next?"

**Mental model:** "A finite path of sounds. You likely need just 10–20 new ones."

**Map legend:**
- Green = already yours
- Amber = small tweak
- Red = new
- Start here: /i/ vs /ɪ/

**Lesson:** "Hear the difference" → options: i • ɪ → aim for 80% to pass

**Mastery:** "You're tuned in." Badge: Recognition unlocked — /i/ vs /ɪ/

**Say it:** "Move your tongue until the zone glows. Hold steady."

**Review game:** "Clear the channel." Timer 00:30; stronger beam on correct

## Brand Lexicon

### Use These Words
- Tune, signal, lock in, path, node, map, quest, clarity, crisp, static, beam, glide

### Avoid These Words
- Grind, streak fear, punishment, "native or nothing," gamified whiplash

## System Prompt — Core Memory (for LLMs)

You are SoundQuest, a calm and precise guide that tunes learners to the finite set of sounds in a language before pushing vocabulary.

**Priorities:**
- Always reduce overwhelm: explain the path as discrete, finite steps
- Start with high-impact vowels and the biggest L1→L2 contrasts
- Use concrete metaphors (radio tuning, recipe vs. bite) and avoid lore
- Keep copy short; celebrate "locked on," avoid punitive language
- In recognition tasks, prefer controlled audio and nonsense syllables to isolate phonemes
- In production tasks, describe articulator targets in plain language and reference the visualizer
- Default palette: #1A535C, #F9DBBD, #FFF1E3, #102940
- Typography: Manrope (headings), Atkinson Hyperlegible (body)

## KPIs

- Time to first mastery badge (recognition) ≤ 8 minutes
- First-session recognition accuracy delta ≥ +25 percentage points
- Visualizer "steady hold" success rate per vowel ≥ 80% within first 3 sessions
- Retention of contrasts after 72 hours via spaced repetition ≥ 70%

## Roadmap Hints

**MVP:** Evaluation → Map → One vowel contrast lesson → Review

**Next:** Expand vowel set; add targeted consonant "special cases"

**Then:** Personalize difficulty by L1→L2 pair; surface shared percentage prominently

**Finally:** Exportable personalized pronunciation guide (PDF) and shareable progress map

## Accessibility and Inclusivity

- Provide captions, keyboard-only flows, and reduced-motion variants
- Avoid shame-based copy; celebrate progress and clarity
- Use neutral, globally understandable metaphors (radio tuning, map/quest)

## Risks and Mitigations

**Risk:** Learners misattribute success to word memorization
- **Mitigation:** Emphasize sound-first wins and show transfer

**Risk:** Overfitting to English↔Spanish
- **Mitigation:** Abstract pipeline; expand dataset-driven contrasts

**Risk:** Mic permissions and device variability
- **Mitigation:** Graceful errors, offline drills, clear mic check

## Landing Page Examples

**Headline:** "Tune in before you speak."

**Subhead:** "Master 10–20 sounds. The rest aligns."

**CTA:** "Map my sounds"

**Secondary:** "How it works"

**Social proof:** "Recognition unlocked in 6 minutes on average."

## FAQ Seeds

**Why sounds before words?**
Because comprehension depends on hearing distinctions your brain hasn't learned yet.

**How many sounds do I need?**
Usually 10–20 new ones; most are already familiar.

**Does this fix my accent?**
It reduces unintelligibility first; native-likeness comes later via refinements.

**What languages?**
Start with English↔Spanish; expand via datasets like PHOIBLE.
